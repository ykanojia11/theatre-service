# Theatre-Service: Solution Overview and Architecture

## Functional Features (Service Implementation)

### Read Scenarios
- **Browse theatres currently running the show (movie selected) in the town, including show timing by a chosen date:**
  - API allows customers to filter theatres by city, movie, and date, returning available shows and timings.
- **Booking platform offers in selected cities and theatres:**
  - Endpoints support querying offers and discounts for specific cities and theatres.
- **50% discount on the third ticket:**
  - Implemented using a discount strategy pattern in the booking service.
- **Tickets booked for the afternoon show get a 20% discount:**
  - Discount logic applies automatically for afternoon show bookings.

### Write Scenarios
- **Book movie tickets by selecting a theatre, timing, and preferred seats for the day:**
  - Booking API validates seat availability, applies discounts, and creates booking records.
- **Theatres can create, update, and delete shows for the day:**
  - Partner APIs allow theatre owners to manage shows and inventory.
- **Bulk booking and cancellation:**
  - Service supports bulk operations for booking and cancellation (extensible for future needs).
- **Theatres can allocate seat inventory and update them for the show:**
  - APIs for partners to manage seat inventory per show.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- **Transactional Scenarios:**
  - Booking operations are transactional; JPA/Hibernate ensures atomicity and consistency.
- **Integration with Existing/New Theatre IT Systems & Localization:**
  - Service layer abstraction allows integration via REST APIs, messaging, or adapters. Localization supported via movie metadata.
- **Scalability & Availability (99.99%):**
  - Microservice architecture, stateless APIs, cloud-native deployment (Docker/Kubernetes), horizontal scaling.
- **Payment Gateway Integration:**
  - Payment logic is extensible; can integrate with third-party payment APIs.
- **Monetization:**
  - Commission fields and partner logic support platform monetization; extensible for ads, premium listings, etc.
- **OWASP Top 10 Protection:**
  - JWT authentication, role-based access, input validation, error handling, and secure configuration address common threats.

## Platform Provisioning, Sizing & Release
- **Technology Choices:**
  - Java 23, Spring Boot 3.4.1, JPA/Hibernate, H2 (local), Swagger, JWT, Spring Security. Cloud-ready.
- **Database, Transactions, Data Modelling:**
  - Relational model with normalized entities; transactional operations for bookings and inventory.
- **Enterprise Systems:**
  - Can integrate with CRM, ERP, payment, and notification systems via APIs.
- **Hosting Solution & Sizing:**
  - Supports cloud, hybrid, or multi-cloud deployment; scalable via containers and orchestration.
- **Release Management:**
  - Modular codebase; supports multi-city, multi-language releases; CI/CD pipeline recommended.
- **Monitoring Solution:**
  - Extensible for Spring Actuator, Prometheus, Grafana, ELK stack for metrics and logging.
- **KPIs:**
  - Booking rates, partner onboarding, uptime, error rates, revenue, etc.
- **High-Level Project Plan & Estimates:**
  - 1. Requirements & Design (1 week)
  - 2. Core API & Entity Implementation (2 weeks)
  - 3. Discount & Booking Logic (1 week)
  - 4. Security & Auth (1 week)
  - 5. Integration & Extensibility (1 week)
  - 6. Testing & Documentation (1 week)
  - 7. Deployment & Monitoring (1 week)
  - **Total Estimate:** 7-8 weeks (can be parallelized)
